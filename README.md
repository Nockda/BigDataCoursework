This is the coursework of Big Data course at UoG.

Summary
The goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourselves with the design, implementation and performance testing of Big Data analysis tasks using Apache Spark. You will be required to design and implement a single reasonably complex Spark application. You will then test the running of this application locally on a data of various sizes. Finally, you will write a short report describing your design, design decisions, and where appropriate critique your design. You will be evaluated based on code functionality (does it produce the expected outcome), code quality (is it well designed and follows good software engineering practices) and efficiency (how fast is it and does it use resources efficiently).
